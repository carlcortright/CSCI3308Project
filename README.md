#Project Proposal: Words of Encouragement
##Description:
An Android Wear application that syncs with the user’s Calendar, Alarm, and To Do List to offer words of encouragement throughout the day based on what they have planned.
##Vision statement: 
Every smartwatch user should wake up with the proper words of encouragement to start their day off right. Not only should their day start off right, but continual encouragement throughout the day will lead to increased happiness and productivity. 
Motivation: Our motivation for this project is to develop an app that will be used everyday. We want our users to look forward to our messages and hopefully it’ll be a bright spot in their day.   
##Risks: 
The main risk that I believe we will face is a lack of knowledge of developing apps for Android wearable devices. We only have one Android watch to test on. If this watch breaks, our team could be a tough spot to finish our project. Our team also has no experience working together. 
##Mitigation Strategy:
As stated above, our main obstacle is the lack of knowledge developing Android wearable apps.  This can be overcome by a thorough, persistent accumulation of knowledge regarding Android wearable apps over the semester.  The Agile development methodology will work nicely with this.  The internet will be our main resource.  We will try to obtain another Android watch at some point, so that we have a backup if the original breaks.  Currently, our team has no experience working together.  However, using messaging apps, we will strive to keep each other up-to-date on the status of the overall project, and our individual parts in it.  We will keep each other accountable and hold in person meetings when necessary.

##Methodology: 
Our group plans to follow the agile development methodology. We think that agile will provide both the efficiency as well as the accountability that our team needs to complete our project by the end of the semester. For our app it is especially important that we can brainstorm and implement new features very quickly, making agile the best choice of methodologies. 

##Project Tracking Software:
- We will be using Trello for our project tracking software. Here is a link to our Trello page: https://trello.com/b/m3tYPAdn/team-to-do
