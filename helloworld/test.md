Title: Words of Encouragement

Vision: Every smartwatch user should wake up with the proper words of encouragement to start their day off right. Not only should their day start off right, but continual encouragement throughout the day will lead to increased happiness and productivity. Motivation: Our motivation for this project is to develop an app that will be used everyday. We want our users to look forward to our messages and hopefully itâ€™ll be a bright spot in their day.

User Acceptance Tests:
-Make sure app opens:
  The base test, have the user click on the app to make sure that it opens appropriately and properly displays a motivational quote.
-Set alarm clock and see if quote appears at the appropriate time
  Have the user set the alarm clock for a specific time, and when that time comes to pass observe that an encouraging message was         displayed on the screen.
-Run above test again, and check to make sure a different quote appears
  Repeat the above test, but make sure that a different motivational quote is displayed, to ensure randomness.
-Set alarm clock for Basketball practice and see if sports quote notification appears
  Check to make sure that the app is displaying activity specific quotes by setting a specific athletic event, and observing that a motivational sports quote appears at the appropriate time.
-Set alarm clock for school test and see if educational motivational quote appears at the appropriate time
  Testing the other main activity category to make sure that an encouraging message appears that has something to do with the accumulation of knowledge or education.  

Automated Tests: 
-Make sure quote generator is random
